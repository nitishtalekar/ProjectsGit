      "15001    I bought the G7 Power Boulder LED 0.5 Watt (5W) 15 Lumen C7 Night Light Bulb, 2900K Soft White Light, E12 Base 2-Pack in September of 2013 to test them out. They have been burning 24 hours a days since then and are still working fine. They definitely are as bright as a 5 watt bulb and are still as bright as when they were new. We haven't had any problems with flicker at all but the bulbs are in standard switch On/Off night light fixtures.\n",

I'm new to djing but not new to music listening. For under $100 I'm very pleased. Replaceable cord, comfortable fitment and stylish as hell. It dont hurt that they match my NS7 perfectly. If your looking for a good sounding, great looking DJ headphones for less the $100 pick these up.\n",

      "3    I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.\n",
