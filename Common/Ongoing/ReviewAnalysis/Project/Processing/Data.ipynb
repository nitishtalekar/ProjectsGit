      "I mistakenly thought that since my multiple stays at other Marriott locations were excellent and clean that this location would be as well. Man was I wrong. This place is terrible. The room was very dirty and there were dead bugs everywhere. The room smelled horrible. I couldn't get the room windows open enough to help remove the smell. It took a while to find this place with all the construction in the area and the awkward road design in the area. I will never stay here again!\n",

      "We got stuck in Orlando Florida and the airline put us up in a Best Western. By the time we got to the hotel it was 2am, we were tired and cranky, and the male receptionist had sharpened his teeth and finger nails into a point -- very creepy. We we got to the room it appeared to not have been cleaned at all. The carpet was wet from the air conditioner to the front of the nearest bed, the lamp shades were bent/faded and there were used test strips on the desk -- looked like it was missed simply because the test strip was the same color of the desk. I took pictures and intended on e-mailing them and a complaint to the corporate office, but never got around to it. To make matters worse, we put the do not disturb sign on the door and the hotel staff knocked on the door at 9am, 10am and 11am wanting to clean the room --- our check out time wasn't until noon. I opened the door and gave a scolding look and said they were too late for cleaning.\n",

My husband and I also woke up in the middle of the night itching, we pulled up the sheets and found bed bugs. We' then packed our stuff and left. I would NEVER EVER recommend anybody stay at this motel. When we approached the owners about the bugs, all they said was  we know, we are trying to get rid of them.

      "We stayed at the sandcastle resort/hotel in virginia beach for three days. Our experience was less than enjoyable. To start off when we arrived to check in, they could not find our reservation and the staff that was working there was extremely rude. They were confident that there was no reservation under our name so i went through my emails and showed them the one i received from them almost a month earlier. Finally after about 20 minutes we received our keys and headed to our room. When we got to our floor they were doing construction in our hallway and being very noisy. I went back to the front desk and requested that we be moved to another floor where there was no construction going on. they advised me they had no other rooms available but assured us that the construction would be done before 4pm. After going back to our room we found the room very dirty and run down. Paint was peeling from the ceiling and there were a lot of stains in the carpet. At this pint i decided not to make a big deal out of it until after we came back from dinner. We returned to the hotel just after 7pm and they were still doing construction on our floor. I wouldnt have minded the construction if it wasn't for the fact that they were very loud and drilling and cutting things with saws. I returned to the front desk again and requested to speak to a manager. After waiting for almost 15 minutes the manager finally arrived. We asked to be moved to a different room again and the manager finally agreed to move us to a suite for the same price we paid for our room. When we got to our room we found that is hasn't even been cleaned yet. The bed sheets were on the floor and there was trash everywhere. Apparently house keeping hasn't cleaned the room yet even though by now it was almost 8pm. At this point i was pretty upset and started to call surrounding hotels. we finally found another hotel that had a room available about a mile down the street. We went back to the front desk and spoke to the manager again. We requested a refund and the manager oked it. This was the worst experience ive ever had at any hotel, and to find out they still haven't refunded or 3 days to my credit card. I've been on the phone several times but have yet to hear back from the manager about the refund. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and am very unhappy with the way we were treated.\n",

There was even trash in the garbage can when we checked into the room, so that was gross. And the housekeepers were loud in the morning and were swearing in the hallway.

What a pleasant surprise to find an inn so clean, comfortable and well-appointed at this price level. The beds were firm, the room was roomy and the in-room fridge was a welcome convenience. In the mornings, we picked up bagels, butter, peanut butter, preserves, cereal, juice, milk and coffee from the free breakfast buffet in the lobby and took them back to the dining area in our room where we supplemented them with cheese, cucumbers and hardboiled eggs that we kept in the fridge. We were able to start each day with a hearty breakfast with no real expense of either time or money. You can be sure we’ll be back there again next year.\n",

      "I was very displeased with my two-night stay at Doubletree in Savannah. It must have been off-season, because the hotel was nearly empty, and that apparently meant there wasn't enough staff to do anything. On Day Two of my stay, my room was still not cleaned by 12:30 p.m., which I found out after stopping back at the hotel to change clothes after spending the morning in town. I made a call to housekeeping at that time, then left the hotel to meet folks for lunch. When I returned about 3:00 p.m., my room was still not cleaned, and I had to call housekeeping again. I again left to walk through the historic district nearby. When I returned at 5:30, I again had to call housekeeping - this time I told them I would wait right there until someone finally came to time how long it took. About 15 minutes later, someone finally came to clean the room. Later that night - that maid had the audacity to knock at the door to ask for a bigger tip. When I checked out the next day, I tipped the valet - who came back a few minutes later on foot. She couldn't move my car because it's a standard transmission, she said, so I'd have to get it myself. She then gave me the keys and walked away - my original tip still in her hand.\n",

It was pretty bare and looked, well, cheap really. The sheets were thin and the tv was small, so paying almost $100 for the room seemed like too much.
