By the time we got to the hotel it was 2am, we were tired and cranky, and the male receptionist had sharpened his teeth and finger nails into a point -- very creepy. We we got to the room it appeared to not have been cleaned at all. The carpet was wet from the air conditioner to the front of the nearest bed, the lamp shades were bent/faded and there were used test strips on the desk -- looked like it was missed simply because the test strip was the same color of the desk. I took pictures and intended on e-mailing them and a complaint to the corporate office, but never got around to it. To make matters worse, we put the do not disturb sign on the door and the hotel staff knocked on the door at 9am, 10am and 11am wanting to clean the room --- our check out time wasn't until noon. I opened the door and gave a scolding look and said they were too late for cleaning.\\n\", 'Sentiment': 'F'}, {'': '2', 'Review': \"The rooms were small, the size or a jail cell or so.

Our experience was less than enjoyable. To start off when we arrived to check in, they could not find our reservation and the staff that was working there was extremely rude. They were confident that there was no reservation under our name so i went through my emails and showed them the one i received from them almost a month earlier. Finally after about 20 minutes we received our keys and headed to our room. When we got to our floor they were doing construction in our hallway and being very noisy. I went back to the front desk and requested that we be moved to another floor where there was no construction going on. they advised me they had no other rooms available but assured us that the construction would be done before 4pm. After going back to our room we found the room very dirty and run down. Paint was peeling from the ceiling and there were a lot of stains in the carpet. At this pint i decided not to make a big deal out of it until after we came back from dinner. We returned to the hotel just after 7pm and they were still doing construction on our floor. I wouldnt have minded the construction if it wasn't for the fact that they were very loud and drilling and cutting things with saws. I returned to the front desk again and requested to speak to a manager. After waiting for almost 15 minutes the manager finally arrived. We asked to be moved to a different room again and the manager finally agreed to move us to a suite for the same price we paid for our room. When we got to our room we found that is hasn't even been cleaned yet. The bed sheets were on the floor and there was trash everywhere. Apparently house keeping hasn't cleaned the room yet even though by now it was almost 8pm. At this point i was pretty upset and started to call surrounding hotels. we finally found another hotel that had a room available about a mile down the street. We went back to the front desk and spoke to the manager again. We requested a refund and the manager oked it. This was the worst experience ive ever had at any hotel, and to find out they still haven't refunded or 3 days to my credit card. I've been on the phone several times but have yet to hear back from the manager about the refund.

I made a call to housekeeping at that time, then left the hotel to meet folks for lunch. When I returned about 3:00 p.m., my room was still not cleaned, and I had to call housekeeping again. I again left to walk through the historic district nearby. When I returned at 5:30, I again had to call housekeeping - this time I told them I would wait right there until someone finally came to time how long it took. About 15 minutes later, someone finally came to clean the room. Later that night - that maid had the audacity to knock at the door to ask for a bigger tip. When I checked out the next day, I tipped the valet - who came back a few minutes later on foot. She couldn't move my car because it's a standard transmission, she said, so I'd have to get it myself.

I booked a package deal which included ferry tickets, a champagne brunch, and two nights at the famed Fairmont Empress hotel.  I kept our hotel location a secret from my husband until we arrived, and I'm so glad I did! After we docked and cleared customs and emerged into the brisk air, we rounded a corner, and got our first look at the majestic old building. It honestly looked like a storybook castle with its pitched gables, gothic Victorian architecture and a fresh dusting of snow. We both audibly gasped.   Once inside, the front desk was busy with other guests from the ferry. My husband and I stood in line but took turns slipping away to poke around the warm, elegant lobby. It had fascinating objects like model steamships and faded photographs of royal and celebrity guests enjoying the hotel's various amenities over the years. We were therefore in a good mood when the customer in front of us threw what might politely be termed a tantrum. The young clerk handled the matter professionally and quickly. By the time she got to us she was incredibly apologetic. By the time we walked away from the desk, we not only had a seriously upgraded room (with a harbor view and free wi-fi) but a lovely written invitation to enjoy a complimentary birthday dessert in the Bengal Lounge! Amazing.  This hotel is wildly romantic in the snow; because of it we stayed largely inside, snuggled into impossibly comfortable sheets and pillows in our luxuriously appointed suite, sampling the abundance of delicious teas (the Empress is famous for their Afternoon Tea service) our room offered. We had breakfast in front of a roaring fire in the Empress Room, which featured heavy dark wood, intricate carvings and ornate candelabra hung amongst tapestries and paintings. We had delicious champagne and curry at night in the Bengal room, overseen by a full-sized tiger (skin, anyway).

At first, the hotel lobby seemed dated and plain, but I felt that I could appreciate the character it had. Then we went up a staircase that was a little spooky, and finally, we got into our room. The carpet looked soiled, the bedspread seemed itchy, the bathroom was very dated, and the air conditioning was set into the window with a gap between the unit and the window itself. We had a child with us, and the windows came down so low, with no security gate or bars. The worst part was probably the lack of ventilation. It was summertime, and the air was stuffy in the room.

As for the location, it's true that the Inn At The Convention Center is near major freeways and minutes from downtown, but the area it's located in is terrible, offering nothing in the way of good food or culture.

Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the front desk and check-in was prompt and quick.  We went to our economy room and quickly found the bathroom facilities were not in working order. The front desk promptly upgraded our room for no charge (although there were many economy rooms still available). After a quick room change we went to check out the pool and hot tub area. The area was clean and well stocked with chairs and towels (and as a bonus, we were the only ones there). The pool was cool and clear, and the hot tup warm. After a quick dip we headed back to our room to enjoy the king size bed, huge flat screen TV, and premium cable. Our stay was very comfortable and no complaints about bed, bedding, or showering facilities.  The continental breakfast was superb. There was fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, and make-your-own waffles.

The Shiodome area is primarily a business district, so unlike other popular Tokyo hotels, the Park Hotel Tokyo's surrounding areas are quiet on the weekends and evenings, though the hustle and bustle of the morning work rush can be daunting. That it's also a business district, however, means that it's a great hub for traveling, with many Tokyo Metro subway lines running through the area, as well the JR Shimbashi train station, leaving travelers a lot of options to get around.  Also, Shimbashi station is centrally located station, just a few stops from the main Tokyo station, Akihabara, the electronics district, and popular tourist destinations like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Ueno.  Taking convenience, location, and atmosphere into location, the Park Hotel Tokyo has been and will likely remain my favorite hotel when visiting Tokyo.\\n\", 'Sentiment': 'T'}, {'': '150', 'Review': \"This hotel was surprisingly well maintained and nice for the price.

Upon reaching the hotel the staff was friendly and greeted me warmly. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was off to my king room accommodations.

Once inside with my luggage, the first thing I noticed was a card with my name on it and a teddy bear in the middle of my ginormous bed. The card welcomed me and the bear ultimately became a keepsake for my nephew. The bedroom was beautiful, and the bathroom was just as nice. The first thing I did was take a nice long, hot bath in the jacuzzi. It was the perfect way to unwind after my drive from Atlanta where I'd just barely fled some unseasonable snow. After the bath, I ordered the duck from the 4-star Peninsula Grill and a glass of champagne. It was my first vacation in almost a decade and I planned to live it up!

It flushed regularly every 5 minutes and made noice. The hair dryer was not working. The hot & cold indicators in the bathroom was interchanged.

When I entered the hotel I was greeted by the receptionist who had my reservation ready and who offered me many ideas as to what to do in the city whenever I left the hotel. My room was spectacular and had a nice big window in which I could see Union Square and all the commotion going on the street, which is nice when you're in a big city and can see all the city lights. The beds were nice and clean which is always a big concern of mine and the bathroom was equipped with many towels and toiletries, which was also really nice. There is absolutely nothing I can complain about seeing as the location, the hotel amenities, and my room were all wonderful. I would definitely stay there again.\\n\", 'Sentiment': 'T'}, {'': '28', 'Review': 'This place is a piece of heaven on earth. As we drove up, we heard the sound of the ocean crashing against the rocks. The building was very open and inviting. The hotel staff greeted us with smiling faces, and offered to help immediately.

The soaps and lotions were heavenly. The lobby had nice areas to relax, and the beach access is as good as it gets. In addition, the pools are quite nice. There is even a slide for the kids and an outdoor bar for lounging and snacking, or drinks.

The hotel also had one of the best complimentary breakfast Ive had at a hotel. There was a huge selection of food.

I booked a package deal which included ferry tickets, a champagne brunch, and two nights at the famed Fairmont Empress hotel.  I kept our hotel location a secret from my husband until we arrived, and I'm so glad I did! After we docked and cleared customs and emerged into the brisk air, we rounded a corner, and got our first look at the majestic old building. It honestly looked like a storybook castle with its pitched gables, gothic Victorian architecture and a fresh dusting of snow. We both audibly gasped.   Once inside, the front desk was busy with other guests from the ferry. My husband and I stood in line but took turns slipping away to poke around the warm, elegant lobby. It had fascinating objects like model steamships and faded photographs of royal and celebrity guests enjoying the hotel's various amenities over the years. We were therefore in a good mood when the customer in front of us threw what might politely be termed a tantrum. The young clerk handled the matter professionally and quickly. By the time she got to us she was incredibly apologetic. By the time we walked away from the desk, we not only had a seriously upgraded room (with a harbor view and free wi-fi) but a lovely written invitation to enjoy a complimentary birthday dessert in the Bengal Lounge! Amazing.  This hotel is wildly romantic in the snow; because of it we stayed largely inside, snuggled into impossibly comfortable sheets and pillows in our luxuriously appointed suite, sampling the abundance of delicious teas (the Empress is famous for their Afternoon Tea service) our room offered. We had breakfast in front of a roaring fire in the Empress Room, which featured heavy dark wood, intricate carvings and ornate candelabra hung amongst tapestries and paintings. We had delicious champagne and curry at night in the Bengal room, overseen by a full-sized tiger (skin, anyway).   This hotel was one of the few I've ever stayed in that I can actually say I was content to just spend time in; wandering various floors, exploring some fascinating history and relaxing in the refined yet comfortable ambiance.  A once in a lifetime stay!\\n\", 'Sentiment': ''}, {'': '34', 'Review': 'We stayed at the Days in on 39th in Brooklyn for about 5 days in December.

I think something was biting in bed and when I pulled the sheet back. I saw dead insects under underneath the sheets I was laying on. The water ran slowly so it was hard to take a quick bath or brush my teeth. There were all kinds of huge spot on the carpet from old spills or leaks.

I was wrong. I am an optimist, and my positive thinking lasted all the way up the stairs and up to about 15 minutes after I got to the room. At first, the hotel lobby seemed dated and plain, but I felt that I could appreciate the character it had. Then we went up a staircase that was a little spooky, and finally, we got into our room. The carpet looked soiled, the bedspread seemed itchy, the bathroom was very dated, and the air conditioning was set into the window with a gap between the unit and the window itself. We had a child with us, and the windows came down so low, with no security gate or bars. The worst part was probably the lack of ventilation. It was summertime, and the air was stuffy in the room. Not at all the crisp, cool feel you look for during a summer getaway. We left the same day and found a room at the LaQuinta with a much better room and an even better rate.\\n', 'Sentiment': 'F'}, {'': '37', 'Review': \"Staying at the Bon Aire on St. Pete Beach is by far the best vacation experience I have ever had in my life. The landscaping is beautiful! I couldn't believe all of the different colored flowers and plants. Also the hotel rooms were great. Everything was kept very sanitary, and the layout of the room couldn't have been better. In my opinion, the greatest plus to have staying at the Bon Aire was being able to get food and drinks all day from Sandbar Bills. Sandbar Bills makes one of the greatest cheese burgers I have ever had in my life. Everything about this resort is just all around amazing, including the location. Right across the street from the resort is a Walgreens that is open 24/7! At night when Sandbar Bills is closed, I could walk across the street and buy a snack. In conclusion, I would recommend staying at the Bon Aire over any other place if you are coming to visit St. Pete Beach.

This year we visited Doubletree by Hilton in Melbourne FL during the holiday season. The hotel's website gave an appearance of being an upscale hotel on the beach. When we arrived the hotel was not what we expected. Parking was difficult. The hotel was under construction and we were constantly running into workers in the lobby and elevator. On our first night's stay I had to call the front desk several times because maintenance was still working on the room next to us after 9pm and there was constant hammering. The water for showers was lukewarm at best and the room was small for a suite. Also there was NO internet available for the hotel rooms so we had to go to the lobby every time we wanted to to a web search for restaurants, surf board rentals or other vacation necessities. The housekeeping staff ignored our request for clean towels even though we called the front desk several times and on the last day of our stay we were down to 1 hand towel for 4 people.

As for the location, it's true that the Inn At The Convention Center is near major freeways and minutes from downtown, but the area it's located in is terrible, offering nothing in the way of good food or culture.

The room was updated with a very large flat screen TV in the living room and even a small TV in the bathroom mirror! Check-in was very quick and easy and all of the staff were extremely friendly. The hotel wasn't stuffy or uppity like other hotels we have been to on the Vegas Strip. The grounds were superbly kept and extremely peaceful at night.   We ate at the various places in the hotel several times and were pleased with each experience. Margaritaville had a great atmosphere and great service.

I told the manager this so he said he could give us a room in a special area of the motel. The room he put us in was dirty with stains on the carpet and walls. We were so exhausted from travelling cross country that we took the substandard room so we could be sure our dogs would be safe. This was by far the worst Super 8 we had ever stayed at.

We were only in the room for 5 or 10 minutes when there was a knock on our door from room service delivering our treats. The dessert tray was amazing! We not only had chcoclate dipped strawberries and fresh baked cookies, but also a GIANT piece of triple chocolate cake. We almost didn't make it to the casino because we almost slipped into a food coma from all the sweets. What also made our stay really nice was the fact that they had free transportation to and from the casino. You could call from your room, and be picked up outside of your room to be driven to the casino. The bus runs 24 hours so it didn't matter if we went late at night or in the middle of the day. The drive is only 5 minutes and they drop you off right in front of the casino. After being in the casino we got picked up and driven back to our room.

There was a fairly large safe in the room where I could store important belongings while I was out, just for added security. There was a television, a refrigerator, and a coffee pot. There was also internet for a small daily fee. The hotel is not only located close to the beach, but also to a lot of shops and restaurants. It is right on the bus line, so it is very easy to just walk outside the hotel and catch a bus to virtually anywhere on the island, including the Manoa neighborhood, the zoo, or even to Hanauma Bay, which is about an hour's drive away from the Waikiki area.

The hotel is located in the skyscraper district of Shiodome and lies within walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and the famous Tsukiji fish auction, a popular tourist attraction.  The Park Hotel Tokyo's service is excellent and the English-speaking staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms, though a bit small, as is common in Japanese hotels, are clean and have a stylish, modern appeal.  The lobby, which is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower, has a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower and there are often soft Jazz concerts in the evenings, giving the hotel a quiet, calm elegance. In the mornings, the lobby is bustling with patrons enjoying the excellent breakfast buffet. The buffet is not included in the room price, but I was fortunate enough to receive coupons on a couple of visits, and the food was excellent.  And when you're not relaxing in the lobby or enjoying your quiet room, the Park Hotel Tokyo is also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants and there is a Starbucks Coffee located in the basement of the adjacent building, along with a convenience store for late-night snacks or drinks.  The Shiodome area is primarily a business district, so unlike other popular Tokyo hotels, the Park Hotel Tokyo's surrounding areas are quiet on the weekends and evenings, though the hustle and bustle of the morning work rush can be daunting. That it's also a business district, however, means that it's a great hub for traveling, with many Tokyo Metro subway lines running through the area, as well the JR Shimbashi train station, leaving travelers a lot of options to get around.  Also, Shimbashi station is centrally located station, just a few stops from the main Tokyo station, Akihabara, the electronics district, and popular tourist destinations like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Ueno.

My stay lasted a week, and all in all, each day was the a slightly different rendition of the first. Between sightseeing, visiting shops for gifts and keepsakes, and hitting up a few bead shops for my jewelry line on Etsy, I got to relax in some of the most luxurious accommodations I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, were all friendly and quick to answer any request. (Once I saw a bellman delivering chocolate covered strawberries that were not on the menu, he made sure I got some too!) It was a fabulous hotel and a place I plan to visit again in the future.

Repeatedly, I was disappointed with this hotel. This hotel is stuck in a time warp for renovations and basic amenities. Even with recent updates in the lobby, the actual rooms lack the much needed updates. On one occassion, my room did not have towels or a shower curtain! Yes, the hotel can fix this but it shows the lack of effort and attention to each room. For a frequent traveler, I found the beds uncomfortable and lumpy. The blow dryer was old and while it seems like a small piece, it's an important luxury. The toiletries were as basic as they come and this is a Courtyard, I expect body lotion or conditioner!

I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.  I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer.   The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping!   I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out. I went back to my room assuming that it would be refilled at some point that night or the next morning. The next night, I tried again - no water. I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water!

After we docked and cleared customs and emerged into the brisk air, we rounded a corner, and got our first look at the majestic old building. It honestly looked like a storybook castle with its pitched gables, gothic Victorian architecture and a fresh dusting of snow. We both audibly gasped.   Once inside, the front desk was busy with other guests from the ferry. My husband and I stood in line but took turns slipping away to poke around the warm, elegant lobby. It had fascinating objects like model steamships and faded photographs of royal and celebrity guests enjoying the hotel's various amenities over the years. We were therefore in a good mood when the customer in front of us threw what might politely be termed a tantrum. The young clerk handled the matter professionally and quickly. By the time she got to us she was incredibly apologetic. By the time we walked away from the desk, we not only had a seriously upgraded room (with a harbor view and free wi-fi) but a lovely written invitation to enjoy a complimentary birthday dessert in the Bengal Lounge! Amazing.  This hotel is wildly romantic in the snow; because of it we stayed largely inside, snuggled into impossibly comfortable sheets and pillows in our luxuriously appointed suite, sampling the abundance of delicious teas (the Empress is famous for their Afternoon Tea service) our room offered. We had breakfast in front of a roaring fire in the Empress Room, which featured heavy dark wood, intricate carvings and ornate candelabra hung amongst tapestries and paintings. We had delicious champagne and curry at night in the Bengal room, overseen by a full-sized tiger (skin, anyway).

It was summer, and there were few vacanies along highway 299, but we felt lucky to find an open spot in a motel, just as darkness was creeping up on us. Unfortunately, there were many obvious reasons for said vacancy. The walls were paper thin, and we could hear the people on the floor above us walk, talk, and urinate. When they turned the shower on, our ceiling suddenly became leaky. The room was small, and dirty, with strange decor. Also, there is a tiny, tacky cage in the parking lot, which claims to have housed Big Foot.

I was wrong. I am an optimist, and my positive thinking lasted all the way up the stairs and up to about 15 minutes after I got to the room. At first, the hotel lobby seemed dated and plain, but I felt that I could appreciate the character it had. Then we went up a staircase that was a little spooky, and finally, we got into our room. The carpet looked soiled, the bedspread seemed itchy, the bathroom was very dated, and the air conditioning was set into the window with a gap between the unit and the window itself. We had a child with us, and the windows came down so low, with no security gate or bars. The worst part was probably the lack of ventilation. It was summertime, and the air was stuffy in the room. Not at all the crisp, cool feel you look for during a summer getaway. We left the same day and found a room at the LaQuinta with a much better room and an even better rate.\\n', 'Sentiment': 'F'}, {'': '206', 'Review': \"The Aquarius hotel and resort in Laughlin Nevada is like being in Las Vegas. It is easily the best hotel on the strip. The ammenities alone make the Aquarius my preferred hotel. They offer an Adult tower, which we always request. The beds are unbeleivably comfortable, which is exactly what we need after spending 4 nights camping on the river. The showers offer the perfect water pressure and lots of hot, hot water. The rooms are large, the views great. Besides the ammentities, the buffet is also the best on the strip, with the best salad bar, and the choicest selections, not to mention free drinks. Definately not the hospital-type food other Laughlin hotel buffets offer. And, the casino itself is the best - funnest slots, good payouts, roomy with good ventilation and lighting.

What also made our stay really nice was the fact that they had free transportation to and from the casino. You could call from your room, and be picked up outside of your room to be driven to the casino. The bus runs 24 hours so it didn't matter if we went late at night or in the middle of the day. The drive is only 5 minutes and they drop you off right in front of the casino. After being in the casino we got picked up and driven back to our room.

My seminar was being held in another hotel in the French Quarter, so I felt that it would be best for me to stay in the French Quarter as well. I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.  I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer.   The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping!   I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out. I went back to my room assuming that it would be refilled at some point that night or the next morning. The next night, I tried again - no water. I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water!

Upon arriving the first thing you'll notice is there is plenty of easily accessible parking, that won't have you walking too far to get to your room. You'll enter and notice a large lobby with good abeyance and quick service. The food offered inside the hotel is great. The food court offers cuisine from all over the world, for cheap and affordable prices. The Indian food was AWESOME, quick and cheap compared to most of the prices you'll be looking at in Vegas. When I entered my room I was stunned by the size. For the $30 a night rate, I was not expecting a large comfortable room! The bathroom was more comfortable than being home. When do you ever get that? The staff at the Riviera was all sorts of friendly, even helping us find our way around the strip and letting us know some fun places to go that our 20 year old friends, and of-drinking-age friends could all have a blast. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm booking my room at the Riviera.\\n\", 'Sentiment': 'T'}, {'': '87', 'Review': \"This hotel is conveniently located just blocks from the world-famous Waikiki beach. The room price was very reasonable, and the hotel had a lot of great amenities, such as a pool, hot tub, bar, restaurant, and gift shop. The room was quite comfortable with a great view of the city, although I know that for a little more money nightly, the hotel also provides rooms that have an ocean view. The room was secure. It had a nice bathroom with a hair dryer. It also had a closet with hangers, and an ironing board and iron. There was a fairly large safe in the room where I could store important belongings while I was out, just for added security. There was a television, a refrigerator, and a coffee pot. There was also internet for a small daily fee. The hotel is not only located close to the beach, but also to a lot of shops and restaurants. It is right on the bus line, so it is very easy to just walk outside the hotel and catch a bus to virtually anywhere on the island, including the Manoa neighborhood, the zoo, or even to Hanauma Bay, which is about an hour's drive away from the Waikiki area. Furthermore, I really liked the hotel lobby--it is a nice open air lobby with tables to sit at and have breakfast. There is a lovely fountain and koi pond. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is on a budget, but would like to experience Hawaii nonetheless.\\n\", 'Sentiment': 'T'}, {'': '178', 'Review': \"We didn't feel at home at the Crowne Plaza near the Pittsburgh, PA airport from the moment we got there.

First, if you can get past the curt responses of the near inhuman clerks in the front office, you will make your way into one of the worst hotel experiences of your life. Taking a trip in the elevator feels as if it will be your last. It is squeaky, smells strongly of cleaning detergents, and runs slowly. Once you arrive on your floor, the smell of cleaning agents is even stronger than the smell of the elevator. It buries itself into one's pores and haunts your entire stay. As for the location, it's true that the Inn At The Convention Center is near major freeways and minutes from downtown, but the area it's located in is terrible, offering nothing in the way of good food or culture. It is a haven for young party animals, noise included. Additionally, the wi-fi is terrible, if and when it works at all.

Our experience was less than enjoyable. To start off when we arrived to check in, they could not find our reservation and the staff that was working there was extremely rude. They were confident that there was no reservation under our name so i went through my emails and showed them the one i received from them almost a month earlier. Finally after about 20 minutes we received our keys and headed to our room. When we got to our floor they were doing construction in our hallway and being very noisy. I went back to the front desk and requested that we be moved to another floor where there was no construction going on. they advised me they had no other rooms available but assured us that the construction would be done before 4pm. After going back to our room we found the room very dirty and run down. Paint was peeling from the ceiling and there were a lot of stains in the carpet. At this pint i decided not to make a big deal out of it until after we came back from dinner. We returned to the hotel just after 7pm and they were still doing construction on our floor. I wouldnt have minded the construction if it wasn't for the fact that they were very loud and drilling and cutting things with saws. I returned to the front desk again and requested to speak to a manager. After waiting for almost 15 minutes the manager finally arrived. We asked to be moved to a different room again and the manager finally agreed to move us to a suite for the same price we paid for our room. When we got to our room we found that is hasn't even been cleaned yet. The bed sheets were on the floor and there was trash everywhere. Apparently house keeping hasn't cleaned the room yet even though by now it was almost 8pm. At this point i was pretty upset and started to call surrounding hotels. we finally found another hotel that had a room available about a mile down the street. We went back to the front desk and spoke to the manager again. We requested a refund and the manager oked it. This was the worst experience ive ever had at any hotel, and to find out they still haven't refunded or 3 days to my credit card.

I told the manager this so he said he could give us a room in a special area of the motel. The room he put us in was dirty with stains on the carpet and walls. We were so exhausted from travelling cross country that we took the substandard room so we could be sure our dogs would be safe. This was by far the worst Super 8 we had ever stayed at. The manager lied to us and violated Super 8 policy when the computer clearly indicated that dogs were welcome at this motel.\\n', 'Sentiment': 'F'}, {'': '36', 'Review': 'After reading so many negative reviews of the Lafayette Hotel in San Diego, I felt like people must be just spoiled with modern hotel amenities and do not appreciate accommodations that are steeped in history. I was wrong. I am an optimist, and my positive thinking lasted all the way up the stairs and up to about 15 minutes after I got to the room. At first, the hotel lobby seemed dated and plain, but I felt that I could appreciate the character it had. Then we went up a staircase that was a little spooky, and finally, we got into our room. The carpet looked soiled, the bedspread seemed itchy, the bathroom was very dated, and the air conditioning was set into the window with a gap between the unit and the window itself. We had a child with us, and the windows came down so low, with no security gate or bars. The worst part was probably the lack of ventilation. It was summertime, and the air was stuffy in the room. Not at all the crisp, cool feel you look for during a summer getaway.

The hotel is located in the skyscraper district of Shiodome and lies within walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and the famous Tsukiji fish auction, a popular tourist attraction.  The Park Hotel Tokyo's service is excellent and the English-speaking staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms, though a bit small, as is common in Japanese hotels, are clean and have a stylish, modern appeal.  The lobby, which is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower, has a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower and there are often soft Jazz concerts in the evenings, giving the hotel a quiet, calm elegance. In the mornings, the lobby is bustling with patrons enjoying the excellent breakfast buffet. The buffet is not included in the room price, but I was fortunate enough to receive coupons on a couple of visits, and the food was excellent.  And when you're not relaxing in the lobby or enjoying your quiet room, the Park Hotel Tokyo is also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants and there is a Starbucks Coffee located in the basement of the adjacent building, along with a convenience store for late-night snacks or drinks.  The Shiodome area is primarily a business district, so unlike other popular Tokyo hotels, the Park Hotel Tokyo's surrounding areas are quiet on the weekends and evenings, though the hustle and bustle of the morning work rush can be daunting. That it's also a business district, however, means that it's a great hub for traveling, with many Tokyo Metro subway lines running through the area, as well the JR Shimbashi train station, leaving travelers a lot of options to get around.  Also, Shimbashi station is centrally located station, just a few stops from the main Tokyo station, Akihabara, the electronics district, and popular tourist destinations like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Ueno.  Taking convenience, location, and atmosphere into location, the Park Hotel Tokyo has been and will likely remain my favorite hotel when visiting Tokyo.\\n\", 'Sentiment': 'T'}, {'': '1', 'Review': \"We got stuck in Orlando Florida and the airline put us up in a Best Western.

I drove up there and arrived pretty late, so I was very tired and ready to get some sleep before the game the next day. After pulling into the small parking lot, I realized after driving around that all the Free Parking spaces were gone, so I had to drive down the street to a paid parking lot. Then, after carrying my luggage all the way to the hotel, I checked in and, in a sleepy haze, threw my stuff down in the room and went to sleep.  Not more than two hours later, I woke up from incredible itching on my arms and legs, so I quickly turned on the light and realized how awfully dirty my room was. Then I looked closer at my bed near the sheets and I literally could see many, if not hundreds, of tiny bedbugs crawling everywhere. I immediately ran to the desk, where no one was there of course, and after waiting for 30 minutes for someone to show up, I demanded another room. I then got the new room key, went up to it, and after opening the door, I saw that this new room was no more clean than the last. And yes, there were just as many bedbugs in this bed.   I grabbed my stuff and walked back to my car and slept there for the rest of the night.

My seminar was being held in another hotel in the French Quarter, so I felt that it would be best for me to stay in the French Quarter as well. I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.  I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer.   The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping!   I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out.

I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water!

The hotel is located in the skyscraper district of Shiodome and lies within walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and the famous Tsukiji fish auction, a popular tourist attraction.  The Park Hotel Tokyo's service is excellent and the English-speaking staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms, though a bit small, as is common in Japanese hotels, are clean and have a stylish, modern appeal.  The lobby, which is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower, has a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower and there are often soft Jazz concerts in the evenings, giving the hotel a quiet, calm elegance. In the mornings, the lobby is bustling with patrons enjoying the excellent breakfast buffet. The buffet is not included in the room price, but I was fortunate enough to receive coupons on a couple of visits, and the food was excellent.  And when you're not relaxing in the lobby or enjoying your quiet room, the Park Hotel Tokyo is also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants and there is a Starbucks Coffee located in the basement of the adjacent building, along with a convenience store for late-night snacks or drinks.  The Shiodome area is primarily a business district, so unlike other popular Tokyo hotels, the Park Hotel Tokyo's surrounding areas are quiet on the weekends and evenings, though the hustle and bustle of the morning work rush can be daunting. That it's also a business district, however, means that it's a great hub for traveling, with many Tokyo Metro subway lines running through the area, as well the JR Shimbashi train station, leaving travelers a lot of options to get around.  Also, Shimbashi station is centrally located station, just a few stops from the main Tokyo station, Akihabara, the electronics district, and popular tourist destinations like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Ueno.  Taking convenience, location, and atmosphere into location, the Park Hotel Tokyo has been and will likely remain my favorite hotel when visiting Tokyo.\\n\", 'Sentiment': 'T'}, {'': '18', 'Review': 'The Beachcomber Resort & Villas is what makes South Florida, South Florida.

There was a fairly large safe in the room where I could store important belongings while I was out, just for added security. There was a television, a refrigerator, and a coffee pot. There was also internet for a small daily fee. The hotel is not only located close to the beach, but also to a lot of shops and restaurants. It is right on the bus line, so it is very easy to just walk outside the hotel and catch a bus to virtually anywhere on the island, including the Manoa neighborhood, the zoo, or even to Hanauma Bay, which is about an hour's drive away from the Waikiki area.

The reviews certainly did not justice for the expereince we were about to have. The hotel was in an excellent location on th beach. We were within a mile of snorkling, horesback riding, and mountain climbing. We also wanted to travel into the city which they offered a shuttle and it was only a few miles away.

We got there a little early and the room wasnÔÇÖt ready, so we went to a nearby Starbucks for about an hour. We came back after check-in time, and the room still wasnÔÇÖt ready. They lady at the desk was nice but incompetent. When we finally got into a room, it was what youÔÇÖd expect from a cheap hotel, and it smelled of cigarettes and cheap cleaning products. I think the worst part of it all was the other clientele there. We had a room on the second floor, which required climbing two flights of stairs.

We had breakfast with Hawaiian themed Disney characters such as Goofy, Mickey, and Minnie which was fun. Playing in the large pool and relaxing in the man-made creek was a great place to be. 3 in our party went to the spa and all came back relaxed and refreshed while my girlfriend, her friend and I went to play on the water slides and generally have a good time.

Since there were three of us traveling together it was difficult to find rooms that accommodated three people. However, when we booked with Ao Chalong we specifically stated that we would be three people and need a third bed.

Later, one of the rooms was charged to another family member who checked in early. Another family member was charged with room service fees for meals they never ordered or received (watch your credit cards closely!). The rooms were dated and the carpeting was gross. The location of the rooms are literally a drive from the front desk, so if you need anything, it's going to take a while. And the maid service?

Despite my lack of ghostly encounters, I still love staying at the hotel because of its historic ambience, tranquility and beachfront location. One of my more pleasant memories of the Galvez is standing on the beach there at dawn, with coffee in hand and watching the sun come up over the ocean. The hotel is close to several of GalvestonÔÇÖs attractions that I like to visit. I come down to eat at nearby Pier 21 and have one of their shrimp poor boys, go shopping on the Strand and visit Moody gardens, which has a great saltwater aquarium and a wonderful rainforest pyramid, loaded with tropical birds and butterflies.

This place turned out to be Charleston, SC. After doing research on hotels in the area, I decided on the Planters Inn on Market Street, a quite luxurious hotel for the area featuring a 4-star dining experience. Upon reaching the hotel the staff was friendly and greeted me warmly. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was off to my king room accommodations. Outside the room was a little round, iron-wrought table set for two overlooking the courtyard. The tall white columns were freshly washed and looked new and fresh plants were out. (The weather was a bit dreary the entire time, so I didn't get to enjoy that feature of the hotel very much.) Once inside with my luggage, the first thing I noticed was a card with my name on it and a teddy bear in the middle of my ginormous bed. The card welcomed me and the bear ultimately became a keepsake for my nephew. The bedroom was beautiful, and the bathroom was just as nice. The first thing I did was take a nice long, hot bath in the jacuzzi. It was the perfect way to unwind after my drive from Atlanta where I'd just barely fled some unseasonable snow. After the bath, I ordered the duck from the 4-star Peninsula Grill and a glass of champagne. It was my first vacation in almost a decade and I planned to live it up! My stay lasted a week, and all in all, each day was the a slightly different rendition of the first. Between sightseeing, visiting shops for gifts and keepsakes, and hitting up a few bead shops for my jewelry line on Etsy, I got to relax in some of the most luxurious accommodations I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, were all friendly and quick to answer any request.

Yes, the hotel can fix this but it shows the lack of effort and attention to each room. For a frequent traveler, I found the beds uncomfortable and lumpy. The blow dryer was old and while it seems like a small piece, it's an important luxury. The toiletries were as basic as they come and this is a Courtyard, I expect body lotion or conditioner!

It flushed regularly every 5 minutes and made noice. The hair dryer was not working. The hot & cold indicators in the bathroom was interchanged.
