      "1    Lithium batteries are something new introduced in the market there average developing cost is relatively high but Stallion doesn't compromise on quality and provides us with the best at a low cost.<br />There are so many in built technical assistants that act like a sensor in their particular forté. The battery keeps my phone charged up and it works at every voltage and a high voltage is never risked.\n",

She is 6 months now and has pretty much out grown it. It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money.\n",

It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.\n",

I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth.\n",

      "15001    I bought the G7 Power Boulder LED 0.5 Watt (5W) 15 Lumen C7 Night Light Bulb, 2900K Soft White Light, E12 Base 2-Pack in September of 2013 to test them out. They have been burning 24 hours a days since then and are still working fine. They definitely are as bright as a 5 watt bulb and are still as bright as when they were new. We haven't had any problems with flicker at all but the bulbs are in standard switch On/Off night light fixtures.\n",

I'm new to djing but not new to music listening. For under $100 I'm very pleased. Replaceable cord, comfortable fitment and stylish as hell. It dont hurt that they match my NS7 perfectly. If your looking for a good sounding, great looking DJ headphones for less the $100 pick these up.\n",

These fans are silent and work fantastically up until they've gotten enough use, and then the motor in them gets louder than most every other fan. Wouldn't recommend.\n",
