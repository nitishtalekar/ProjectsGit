      "15001    I bought the G7 Power Boulder LED 0.5 Watt (5W) 15 Lumen C7 Night Light Bulb, 2900K Soft White Light, E12 Base 2-Pack in September of 2013 to test them out. They have been burning 24 hours a days since then and are still working fine. They definitely are as bright as a 5 watt bulb and are still as bright as when they were new. We haven't had any problems with flicker at all but the bulbs are in standard switch On/Off night light fixtures.\n",

I'm new to djing but not new to music listening. For under $100 I'm very pleased. Replaceable cord, comfortable fitment and stylish as hell. It dont hurt that they match my NS7 perfectly. If your looking for a good sounding, great looking DJ headphones for less the $100 pick these up.\n",

These fans are silent and work fantastically up until they've gotten enough use, and then the motor in them gets louder than most every other fan. Wouldn't recommend.\n",
