                                   The success of ‘Agar.io’ and ‘Slither.io.’ gave birth to this new genre of online games which we today call as .io games!
The general mantra of .io games is keeping game mechanics very simple, matched by basic graphics and an ability to play multiplayer games at the click of a mouse.
<br>
These key features allow the games to be easily consumed and played to a high level of satisfaction over the course of 5 - 10-minute period.</p><p>
Let’s go into understanding the uniqueness of .io games and the rise of Fake Multiplayer- <br>
<b>What are .io games and what lead to their popularity?</b><br>
The .io domain is essentially a country code top-level domain for the British Indian Ocean Territory. Much like how Canada uses .ca or India uses.in. 
The two first and biggest io games -Agar.io and Slither io- both used .io as their domain of choice, so, it became the de facto standard for similar games and eventually morphed into the name of the genre.<br>
The most comprehensive definition of a .io game one can come up with is that a .io game is a free to play, browser-based, casual game which has a multiplayer component, very few mechanisms, and minimalist graphics.<br>
With the launch of Agar.io in May 2015, PewDiePie called it his “new favourite game,” and he subsequently covered it at least nine more times.
This became the spark for lighting the .IO game fuse. In the year after the launch of Agar.io, the phrase ‘.IO games’ became the number one gaming search term in the U.S., and more and more online games started to register .IO domains.<br>
The popularity of .IO games continues unabated, fuelled primarily by their accessibility. They are free to play and available via any web browser. Requiring only a basic internet connection to run, .IO games run on virtually any device.</p><p>
You must be wondering what are these games coded in?<br>
Here it is!<br>
.io games have great versatility when it comes to coding. They can be coded using JavaScript, C++, and C#.<br>
But part of the beauty of developing .io games is the simplicity of coding and designing.<br>
Some of the most popular games are generating daily revenues of more than $100,000 through premium content and ad revenues.<br>
From indie developers to powerful production powerhouses, the entire creative gaming community has a stake in the ongoing success of .IO games.</p><p>
<b>Here are some Popular .IO games in the world-</b><br>
1) Diep.io - This is a fun little game that instantly reminds me of the old video game classic, Asteroids. In Diep.io, you take control of a ‘tank’ in which you must shoot at geometric shapes.<br>
2) Agar.io - In Agari.io, players are engaged in an eat-or-be-eaten scenario. They navigate a map to find food and gain in size, eventually becoming large enough to begin consuming the smaller cells of other players, while having to evade threats from larger-celled players.<br>
3) Slither.io – In this game, Players control an avatar resembling a worm, which consumes multi-coloured pellets, both from other players and ones that naturally spawn on the map in the game, to grow in size.</p><p>

Are you also wanting to become an IO game developer?<br>
Here are some skills needed to become one!<br>
Determination and enthusiasm will be the primary fuel for your IO game fire.<br>
Along with the ambition to succeed, the skills needed are a good working knowledge of some necessary coding. An understanding and proficiency of C++ and C# are highly recommended.<br>
There are a ton of resources out there and free game engines like Godot to hone your craft.<br>
As with many more indie developments, you can harness the power of multiple game engines, using some free to use engines, as well as simple code, can help develop IO games.
</p><p>
This genre of online gaming has become a hugely diversified group of games held together by their ease of access, multiplayer foundations, and a domain name.
And for as long as this popularity holds, developers will continue to iterate, both with new memes and new mechanics, keeping this reinvigoration of browser multiplayer games going.
