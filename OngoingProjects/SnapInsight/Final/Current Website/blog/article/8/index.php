India, a country with a population of 1.3 billion people, is a land of infinite possibilities and endless opportunities. With 68% of our population living in Rural India, this rural population represents a massive opportunity that requires a variety of technologies to support them.</p><br>
<p>
This population represents a massive potential which can be tapped to bring a constructive change across the country.<br>
And as the spending capability of the rural population rises, the villages of India are becoming a centre of attention for multiple industries to invest in. However, due to poor road infrastructure, connectivity, poor power facilities, sanitation issues, the progress of these regions gets hindered and trapped.<br><br>
So, you must be wondering, how are we going to transform these rural regions to vibrant places with wholesome facilities?<br>
There comes a massive potential here, where technology can act as a positive intervention to bring out a change in these regions!<br><br>
Would you like to know how Technology is bringing about this change? </p>
<p>
Let’s explore some of the technological interventions that are supporting rural India<br><br>

<b>The Rural Technology Lab</b> – An initiative of the SELCO Foundation, set up in Ujire, Karnataka, SELCO Labs spends time understanding the problems that the local community faces and then finds technologies to address them. Some of these include attempting to create a low-cost clothes dryer that doesn’t require electricity that can help villagers in the rainy season when drying clothes outside is not an option. Another technology solution that this team has been testing is an inexpensive fruit dryer that preserves bananas and creates more demand for farmers’ crops year-round.<br><br>

<b>E-Choupal</b> - Another beautiful initiative of ITC Limited which is to link directly with rural farmers via the Internet for procurement of agricultural and aquaculture products like soybeans, wheat, coffee, and prawns. The programme installs computers with Internet access in rural areas of India to offer farmers up-to-date marketing and agricultural information. <br>
There are 6,100 e-Choupals in operation in 35,000 villages in 10 states affecting around 4 million farmers. <br><br>

<b>PURA</b> - Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas has also been an innovative social inclusion programme for rural development, introduced by none other than the Missile man of India – Dr A.P.J Abdul Kalam, which aims to provide Physical, Electronic and Knowledge connectivity to the rural hubs of India.</p><br>
<p>
You must be also looking for some Examples of Villages which are being transformed by various Technology driven initiatives.<br><br>

Here are a few – <br>
<b>Govardhan Eco-Village</b> – An Eco Wellness Retreat located in Palghar, Maharashtra is using a three-pronged approach for water resource development which includes community owned lift irrigation systems for perennial irrigation facility, drinking water facilities and water resource conservation through check dams and restoring community wells and ponds.
<br><br>
 <b>Technology Village Programme of the Govt of Chhattisgarh</b>- With established Technology Village Centres in the District of Bilaspur and Balrampur in Chhattisgarh, this Programme is trying to improve the quality of living of the rural population by undertaking training and awareness building activities for adoption of technologies by the villages. <br>
The Programme also involves application of Problem-specific technologies for Farmers.</p>

<p>The Way forward <br><br>
The Rural Belt of India representing a massive potential resource for change, still has a long way to go to truly reap the benefits that technology can offer.
There is a need for a lot more technology entrepreneurs & social entrepreneurs to understand the specific needs of the rural Indian population and to find low cost solutions for them.<br>
Coupled with that, with good training and awareness of ethics and values for the rural youth, this combo of Technology & Righteousness would create wholesome citizens for utilising those technologies for meaningful and constructive causes for a Better India, A Better World!
