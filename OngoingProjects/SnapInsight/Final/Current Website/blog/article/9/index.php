                            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.</p><br>
<p>
This interdisciplinary science is creating a paradigm shift in the working of virtually every industry.<br>
Businesses which are employing latest technologies like AI and Data Analytics are gaining a cutting edge over their competitors and are significantly saving costs, and rendering services to their customers with a lot of efficiency.</p><br>
<p>
Today we discuss about how is this highly trending Technology reshaping the Healthcare as well as the Food Industry!<br>

Are you ready to discover?<br>

Let’s start with the impact of AI on the Healthcare Sector-<br><br>
AI and advanced analytics are rapidly transforming the healthcare industry from leveraging data for efficient diagnosis to pattern recognition for treatments to resolving logistical challenges.<br>
The unique characteristic of AI as compared to other traditional technologies in health care is its ability to gain information, process it and give a well-defined output to the end-user.</p><br><p>

Let’s look into the Various specialties in medicine have shown an increase in research in AI- <br><br>

1) Disease Diagnosis – Artificial Intelligence has tremendously improved the accuracy of the diagnosis of diseases. A leading provider of AI-powered technology for pathology labs called PathAI is developing a machine learning technology to assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions for cancer diagnosis.<br><br>

2) AI-Powered Radiology Assistant – Based in Israel, Zebra Medical Vision is providing radiologists with an AI-enabled assistant that receives imaging scans and automatically analyses them for various clinical findings it has studied.<br><br>
An interesting aspect of AI in Healthcare is its usage in the development of medicines.</p><br><p>


Here are some companies that rely on AI to develop the next wave of medicines-<br><br>
1) BioXcel Therapeutics – A company based in Connecticut, USA uses AI to identify and develop new medicines in the fields of immuno-oncology and neuroscience. Their work in AI-based drug development was named as one of the “Most Innovative Healthcare AI Developments of 2019."<br><br>

2) BERG Health - A clinical-stage, AI-based biotech platform that maps diseases to accelerate the discovery and development of breakthrough medicines. By combining its “Interrogative Biology” approach with traditional R&D, BERG can develop more robust product candidates that fight rare diseases.<br>
Now you must be wondering, what could be some of AI’s Applications in the Food & Hospitality Industry?<br>
Have your ever waited in a counter of a fast-food restaurant confused what to order? Well, with the development of AI, many Food and Beverage Companies are leveraging the efficiency that it can offer!<br><br>
</p><br><p>

Here we go as we discover how Artificial Intelligence is transforming the Food Industry- <br><br>
1) Food Product - Now as we know that the progress of a food product or service is a lengthy process, but by using AI which is known for its speed and accuracy in providing the output, we will be able to use massive datasets of specific agricultural info and method it faster. <br><br>

2) Cleansing of Processing Equipment – For effective hygiene standards, careful cleansing of equipment becomes really important. To help in optimizing this process, analysts of University of Nottingham have made a Self-Optimizing-Clean-In-Place System that uses AI to diminish cleaning period and resources. It really is expected that system can help in keeping up to $129.8 million per year.<br><br>

3) Enhancing Supply Chain Management - With new food safety regulations and the increasing need for transparency, supply chain management is a top priority for all food companies. Several business verticals are employing AI to control their materials. AI is offering a great fillip to check and monitor foodstuff safety items during all stages of supply string. </p><br><p>

From creating exact forecasts to control pricing and stock, it helps every phase. Since it enables end-to-end monitoring from plantation to consumer, it offers great transparency. <br>


Lastly, Artificial Intelligence is not only helping to accomplish repetitive tasks proficiently, but is also assisting food manufacturers to monitor consumer requirement and related items. <br><br>


Prospects for the Future- <br><br>
From virtual assistants to Medicine Development in the Healthcare industry, to bringing in transparency and hygiene in the Food Industry, a wide number of applications of AI are well positioned to improve these industries.<br><br>
For the Healthcare industry, with this explosion in innovation, it’s important for healthcare professionals and other stakeholders to understand the regulations set in place for the effective development and deployment of these technologies.<br><br>
For the Food & Beverage Industry, Artificial Intelligence will play a big role in the Fourth Manufacturing Revolution, with experts saying it will become a must-have for manufacturers.<br><br>

With the potential that this technology can offer, the prospects of AI look manifold and would play a big role from Farm to Fork.
